## Tips for Best Results

### Color Matching
- FFXIV dyes don't cover all colors equally
- Some colors (like pink) have many options
- Others (like brown) have fewer but very specific matches

### Market Prices
- Some dyes are cheap (vendor)
- Others are expensive (rare drops, crafted)
- Check the Universalis price before committing!

### Colorblindness
- ~8% of men have some form of color vision deficiency
- Always check your glamour with the Accessibility tool
- Especially important for FC uniforms
