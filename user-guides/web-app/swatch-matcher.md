- **Lighting matters** - Colors appear differently in various zones
- **Test in-game** - Use the dye preview before committing

## Understanding Delta E

Delta E measures how close a dye is to your selected color:

| Delta E | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| 0-1 | Virtually identical |
| 1-2 | Very close, minor difference |
| 2-10 | Noticeable but similar |
| 10+ | Visibly different |

Lower scores mean better matches!
