## Understanding Delta E

Delta E measures perceptual color difference:

| Delta E | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| 0-1 | Not perceptible |
| 1-2 | Perceptible through close observation |
| 2-10 | Perceptible at a glance |
| 11-49 | Colors are more similar than opposite |
| 100 | Colors are exact opposites |

Lower is always better for matching!
