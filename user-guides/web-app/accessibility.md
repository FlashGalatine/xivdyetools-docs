# Accessibility Checker

**Simulate how colors appear with different types of color vision**

The Accessibility Checker helps you understand how your color choices appear to people with various forms of color blindness.

## How to Use

### 1. Select Colors

Enter colors to check:
- **Single color** - See how one dye appears
- **Multiple colors** - Check a color palette together
- **From other tools** - Use dyes from Palette Extractor, Harmonies, etc.

### 2. Choose Vision Type

| Type | Affects | Population |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Protanopia** | Red perception | ~1% of males |
| **Deuteranopia** | Green perception | ~1% of males |
| **Tritanopia** | Blue perception | ~0.01% |
| **Achromatopsia** | All color (grayscale) | Very rare |
| **Protanomaly** | Reduced red | ~1% of males |
| **Deuteranomaly** | Reduced green | ~5% of males |

### 3. View Simulation

The tool shows:
- **Original colors** - How you see them
- **Simulated colors** - How they appear with color blindness
- **Side-by-side comparison** - Easy visual reference
- **Contrast warnings** - If colors become too similar

## Understanding Color Blindness

### Red-Green Color Blindness (Most Common)
- Protanopia/Deuteranopia: Red and green appear similar
- Affects ~8% of males, ~0.5% of females
- Many reds, oranges, greens, and browns become hard to distinguish

### Blue-Yellow Color Blindness (Tritanopia)
- Blue and yellow appear similar
- Much rarer than red-green
- Affects blues, purples, and yellows

### Complete Color Blindness (Achromatopsia)
- Sees only in grayscale
- Extremely rare
- Relies on brightness differences

## Why This Matters

When designing glamours or housing:
- **Party coordination** - Ensure teammates can distinguish roles by color
- **FC events** - Color-coded teams should be distinguishable
- **Accessibility** - Be inclusive of players with color blindness
- **Contrast** - High contrast helps everyone

## Tips for Accessible Color Choices

1. **Don't rely on color alone** - Use pattern/texture differences too
2. **High contrast** - Brightness differences help when hue fails
3. **Test red-green combos** - Most common issue
4. **Blue + orange** - Often works better than red + green
5. **Check multiple types** - What works for one may not for another

## WCAG Contrast

The tool also shows WCAG contrast ratios:

| Level | Ratio | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| AA | 4.5:1 | Normal text |
| AAA | 7:1 | Enhanced accessibility |
| AA Large | 3:1 | Large text/icons |
