# Gradient Builder

**Create smooth color gradients between two dyes**

The Gradient Builder helps you visualize color transitions and find intermediate dyes for gradient-style glamours.

> **Note**: This tool was previously called "Dye Mixer" in v3.x. The Discord bot still uses the `/mixer` command for this functionality.

## How to Use

### 1. Select Two Dyes

Choose your starting and ending colors:
- **Search by name** - Type to find dyes
- **Pick from list** - Browse by category
- **Use favorites** - Quick access to saved dyes

### 2. View the Gradient

The builder displays:
- **Color gradient** - Smooth transition between the two dyes
- **Intermediate points** - 5-10 steps along the gradient
- **Matched dyes** - Closest FFXIV dye for each point

### 3. Explore Intermediate Dyes

Each intermediate color shows:
- The calculated color at that point
- The closest matching FFXIV dye
- How close the match is (Delta E)

## Tips

- **Bold gradients** work best with high-contrast endpoints
- **Subtle gradients** use similar colors for gentle transitions
- Some **intermediate matches** may be better than others
- Try the **reverse direction** for different intermediate dyes
