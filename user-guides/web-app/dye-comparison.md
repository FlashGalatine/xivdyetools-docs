## How to Use

### 1. Add Dyes to Compare

Add up to 4 dyes using:
- **Search** - Type a dye name
- **Browse** - Select from categories
- **From other tools** - Use "Add to Comparison" from Palette Extractor, Harmonies, etc.

### 2. View Comparison

The comparison shows:
- **Color swatches** - Large side-by-side display
- **Dye names** - In your selected language
- **Categories** - Which category each belongs to
- **Hex codes** - Exact color values
- **Color distance matrix** - How similar each pair is

### 3. Slot Selection

When all 4 slots are full and you add another dye:
- **Slot Selection Modal** appears
- Choose which slot to replace
- Click the dye you want to swap out

## Color Distance Matrix

The matrix shows how similar each pair of dyes is:

| Distance | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 0-10 | Very similar |
| 10-25 | Noticeably different |
| 25-50 | Quite different |
| 50+ | Very different |

This helps identify which dyes might look too similar in-game.
