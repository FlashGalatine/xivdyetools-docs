## Harmony Types Explained

### Complementary
Two colors opposite each other. Creates maximum contrast and visual pop.

**Example**: Dalamud Red + Celeste Green

### Triadic
Three colors equally spaced (120° apart). Balanced and visually interesting.

**Example**: Wine Red + Gobbiebag Brown + Regal Purple

### Analogous
3-4 colors next to each other on the wheel. Creates harmony and flow.

**Example**: Coral Pink + Salmon Pink + Rose Pink

### Split-Complementary
Base color + two colors adjacent to its complement. Less tension than complementary.

### Tetradic (Rectangle)
Four colors forming a rectangle. Rich possibilities but harder to balance.
